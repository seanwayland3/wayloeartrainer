unfinished app for ear training 
Application allows you to select notes from the chromatic scale and generate a randomly chosen melody of 2, 4 or 6 notes. You can choose from one or 2 octave range. Press play to hear the melody. Press play again and a new melody will be selected. The repeat button plays the last melody again as many times as you wish. On the right hand side are buttons to play each of the 12 notes to test yourself. Reset allows you to change the selected notes. By limiting the notes chosen and practice you should be able to remember all 12 notes. I would try adding one note a month for a year. Start with white notes then add black ones. more details and other cool applications at www.seanwayland.com any problems please email seanwayland@gmail.com
